# Emojis
Please follow these guidelines for emojis:
- Use a 256x256 canvas with a transparent background (unless the emoji entails otherwise)
- Avoid anti-aliasing (unless you need it for zooming/resizing, or messing with rotation/perspective)
- Important features such as eyes or mouth should be at least 4 pixels large (usually this is the outline/border)
- Important features should be visible at the same resolution the project description displays them

We will introduce more styles of emojis at a later date.
